A past-his-prime couch surfer with no fixed address, whose endless days of going with the flow are jeopardized by a wave of bad breaks that threaten to end his ride. As Leroy tests the limits of just squeaking by, he alarms friends and family by skirting their standard advice. Played brilliantly by Lawrence Jansen, his charming delivery deceptively cloaks a radical definition of success in the modern world. HOW TO SCORE YOUR LIFE's name is at the heart of the film, but director Steven Tanenbaum created a counter intuitive character to provoke viewers to apply the title to themselves after the credits roll.","language":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","metascore":"N/A","type":"movie","id":"aa33a5c9-918c-49b8-a341-192cf06d29a4"}
