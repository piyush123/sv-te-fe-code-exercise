Now in their mid-twenties, they find their family splintering apart in the wake of their parents' divorce. As property has divided, their summer cabin has fallen into the possession of their mother, who is intent on selling it. With the knowledge that this is their last trip to a favorite childhood place, Owen and Rosie organize an Independence Day weekend getaway for them and their closest friends. In tow: Owen's longtime girlfriend Aliz, her best friend Charlotte, Charlotte's long-distance beau Micah, and Rosie's new boyfriend-- a yoga instructor named Dusty that rubs everyone else the wrong way. In the days leading up to the Fourth, Owen and Rosie squabble about their parents divorce and the future of the cabin. Dusty learns of the impending sale and offers to buy the cabin for Rosie, which doesn't sit well with Owen. Meanwhile, Micah and Charlotte enjoy being in the same place for once-- a scenario which clues Charlotte into Micah's attempts to cover up his troubles with alcohol addiction.
