Filmed live before a packed house at the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas, this comedy event features Holcomb doing what he does best: offering spirited, opinionated advice about relationships gone awry. Holcomb is best likened to a perfect blend of legendary comedians, Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor, with a sprinkle of Rudy Ray Moore. He's explicit, honest, and his thoughts are loaded with raunchy, in-your-face comedy. Holcomb is as authentic as it gets, and the prescriptions he's serving up are not for the weak at heart or thin-skinned.","language":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","metascore":"N/A","type":"movie","id":"a6a0ea91-a2db-4de5-9db0-4aae9c0e3826"}
