When revenue is generated at the gate it is often donated to a worthy cause. The United States Lawn Mower Racing Association's race in Sparta, MI is a classic example of this. The Mikula family, who have lost six members to Huntington's disease host an annual race in their hometown to raise research money and awareness of this little known disease. On Your Mark, Get Set, MOW! will explore the world of lawn mower racing and how it is being used to as a race for a cure. Through on camera interviews with medical professionals, US congressmen, and Arlo Guthrie, who lost his father Woody Guthrie to the disease, an understanding of the disease will be established.
